# Data_Visualization-EDA on Superstore Dataset

Every successful business runs on data — but real value comes from understanding what the numbers actually mean.
In this project, I took a deep dive into sales data Superstore Dataset (2014–2017) to answer one big question:
How can we make smarter decisions to boost profit and growth?

The dataset covers more than 9,000 transactions, including details about products, customers, sales, profit, and shipping.

What did I set out to do?

Spot the patterns: When do people buy the most? Which months or seasons matter?
Find the winners and losers: Which products, regions, and customers are truly profitable? Which are dragging us down?
Dig into the "why": What really drives profit or loss? (Is it discounts, shipping, location, or something else?)
Predict the future: Can we build a model that accurately predicts profit for new orders?
Share clear, practical insights any manager could use.
You'll see not just fancy charts and numbers, but a story:
How a superstore can use its data to work smarter, not just harder.
